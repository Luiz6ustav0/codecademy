# Bucketlist api

This app is a basic bucketlist made to learn a little bit of flask. You should be able to run it smoothly if you have postgresql installed :)

After installing the requirements you must(considering you're in the root of this repo):
```bash
source .env.sh
```
```python
flask run
```
